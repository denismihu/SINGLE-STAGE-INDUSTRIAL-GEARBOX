# SINGLE-STAGE-INDUSTRIAL-GEARBOX
Introduction

This project presents the design and analysis of a single-stage industrial gearbox, primarily used for an industrial mixer. 
The project includes detailed calculations and design considerations for the gearbox components, focusing on a spur gear mechanism. 
All calculations and simulations were performed using MATLAB.

Project Description

Gearbox Design: The project involves designing a single-stage gearbox with spur gears. The material used for gears is OLC 45 quality carbon steel, and OL 50 carbon steel for shafts.
Calculation Details: In-depth calculations include gear tooth strength analysis, load distribution, bending stress verification, and final geometric design of gears and shafts.
MATLAB Simulations: Utilized MATLAB for simulations and calculations, ensuring precise and accurate results for the gearbox design.

Key Components

Spur Gears: Selection of gear specifications including tooth count, module, and gear geometry.
Shaft Design: Detailed design of the output shaft including diameter, length, and material specifications.
Bearing Selection: Identification and selection of appropriate rolling bearings from the SKF catalogue.
